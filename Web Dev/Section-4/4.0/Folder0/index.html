<!-- -------NOTE FOR ME------- There are Two Types of File System Absolute and
Relative -> in absolute file path the file is located from the root directry
like from C drive ex:- C:\Users\ys508\Music\Programming\Web
Dev\Section-4\4.0\dog.png -> but in relative file path file is located from the
folder we are working in like ex:- ../dog.png In Relative Filepath ./ is used to
access currec filpath aree file in current directory and ../ is used to acess
file above the current folder (previous direcory) ex :- ./rabbit.png -->
